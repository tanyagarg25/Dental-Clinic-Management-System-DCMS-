# Dental-Clinic-Management-System-DCMS-

## **Executive Summary**
**Objective:** The goal of this project was to design and develop a proof-of-concept (POC) solution to modernize LDO Dental Office's record-keeping and operational processes. By leveraging Microsoft SQL Database and Azure tools, the aim was to enhance patient management, appointment scheduling, drug tracking, and reporting capabilities.

**Context:** LDO is a local dental office managing around 500 patients with a growing demand for its services. Currently, all records are maintained manually, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and operational bottlenecks. The DCMS replaces manual processes with an automated, cloud-based solution, facilitating scalability and improving patient and staff experiences.

## **Business Problem**
**Problem Identification:** LDO Dental Office struggled with manual processes that were time-consuming and error-prone. This inefficiency became increasingly critical as patient demand outpaced the staff's ability to manage appointments, drug inventories, and medical records.

**Business Impact:** Manual record-keeping reduced staff productivity and heightened the risk of compliance issues. The lack of a centralized database for patient and drug management limited operational visibility and impeded scalability.

## **Methodology**
**Data Modeling & Database Development**

**Microsoft SQL Database:** A relational database was designed to handle patient records, appointment scheduling, drug administration, and supplier tracking. Entity-relationship (ER) diagrams and schemas were developed to ensure data integrity and compliance.
Analysis Techniques:

**Data Entry Forms:** Forms were created for efficient data entry, allowing staff to record patient details, appointments, and drug-related information with minimal errors.
Dashboards and Reporting: KPIs and interactive visualizations were designed to support real-time decision-making and streamline staff workflows.
